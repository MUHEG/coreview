usethis::use_gpl_license(version = 3, include_future = TRUE) # You can set another license here
golem::use_readme_rmd(open = FALSE)
devtools::build_readme()
# Note that `contact` is required since usethis version 2.1.5
# If your {usethis} version is older, you can remove that param
# usethis::use_code_of_conduct(contact = "Golem User")
usethis::use_lifecycle_badge("Experimental")
usethis::use_news_md(open = FALSE)

## Init Testing Infrastructure ----
